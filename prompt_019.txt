Request: I'm facing two issues in the Android Studio UI: 1) there is no AVD Manager option in the tools menu and I can't find it anywhere. There is a Device Manager option, is that renamed from AVD? 2) The UI should an error in the gradle file: A problem occurred evaluating root project 'FeatureVotingPlatform'.
> Build was configured to prefer settings repositories over project repositories but repository 'Google' was added by build file 'build.gradle'

CONTEXT: User is setting up Android Studio and encountering common issues with newer versions

RESOLUTION:
1. Confirmed AVD Manager was renamed to "Device Manager" in newer Android Studio versions
2. Fixed Gradle repository configuration error by removing conflicting allprojects repositories from root build.gradle
3. Updated SETUP.md to use correct "Device Manager" terminology
4. Instructed user to sync project to resolve remaining issues

FILES MODIFIED:
- /Users/raitamarindo/Repos/MetaCTO/AIChallenge/android/build.gradle (removed allprojects repositories)
- /Users/raitamarindo/Repos/MetaCTO/AIChallenge/android/SETUP.md (updated AVD Manager â†’ Device Manager references)

STATUS: Android Studio setup issues resolved, project should now sync successfully
