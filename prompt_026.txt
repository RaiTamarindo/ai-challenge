Request: Cool its working but it seems the app is missing the /api/v1 route prefix on all requests to the API, could you review the android app and fix it please?

CONTEXT: Android app is running but API calls are failing because they're missing the /api/v1 prefix that the backend uses

RESOLUTION NEEDED: Update ApiClient.kt and ApiService.kt to include proper /api/v1 base URL prefix

STATUS: Need to fix API endpoint configuration to match backend routes
