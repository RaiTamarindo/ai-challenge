Ok I want you toi build software for a feature voting platform from scratch. Its functional requirements are: 1) should support users to propose features 2) should support users to list features all users created 3) should support users to vote on features they think would be good to have 4) each feature should hold a count of unique users that voted on it. Its non functional requirements are: 1) should use a database server to store the users, features and its counts 2) should have a backend API that interacts with the database server 3) should have a frontend UI implemented in native Android so it is possible to access the platform feature through a friendly UI. Please do it in stages so I can review and iterate with each one. Propose a list of stages, but I wanted to start with the database techonolgy choice and data modelling, then go up stream up to the UI.
