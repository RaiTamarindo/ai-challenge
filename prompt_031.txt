USER PROMPT 031:

Request: Let me update you about the UI issues:
- Plus (+) button that creates new feature requests seems disabled, but it works
- All features shows as Created by: null
- When voting a feature, UI doesn't updates the votes count, it only updates when loading all features
- When voting a feature, the error alert is now: Network error: Parameter specified as non-null is null: method com.feature... (maybe would be good to log that error instead of showing it in the UI)

CONTEXT: After migration fixes, user identified several UI issues in the Android app:
1. FAB button appears disabled but functions
2. Created by field showing null instead of usernames
3. Vote counts not updating in real-time after voting
4. Kotlin null parameter error being shown to users instead of proper error handling

RESOLUTION NEEDED:
1. Fix FAB visual appearance
2. Fix created_by_user field mapping/display
3. Improve real-time vote count updates after voting
4. Better error handling to log technical errors and show user-friendly messages

STATUS: Multiple Android UI/UX issues to address
