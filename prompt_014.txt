Cool, I just fixed a "no new variable" error in the vote.go file and it is working now. I would like to ask you so I can continue reviewing, could you add a new application entrypoint under backend/cmd/cli/main.go that contains a command to add a new user. 1) add a new Makefile target so I can create a new user by running `make user name=Rai email=raitamarindo@gmail.com password=12345` 2) update the Dockerfile so it have a target for cli commands
