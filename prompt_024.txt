Request: Now sync is failing with this message: Minimum supported Gradle version is 8.13. Current version is 8.10.2. Try updating the 'distributionUrl' property in /Users/raitamarindo/Repos/MetaCTO/AIChallenge/android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties to 'gradle-8.13-bin.zip'.

CONTEXT: After updating build configuration, AGP 8.12.1 requires minimum Gradle version 8.13, but I downgraded to 8.10.2

RESOLUTION: Need to update Gradle wrapper back to version 8.13 as required by AGP 8.12.1

STATUS: Simple fix - update gradle-wrapper.properties to use Gradle 8.13
