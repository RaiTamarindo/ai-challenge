Ok there was one issue with the Dockerfile go image version, I manually changed that to match the go.mod version. Also renamed dev Makefile target to "up" and added a "down" target as well, please review that. Also there is still a docker build error on the go build command, what you aim with the installsuffix stuff? It seems it is missing some libraries in the go.sum, please run go mod tidy and check if it solves the issue.
