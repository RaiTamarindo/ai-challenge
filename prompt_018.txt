Lets move on to the Android development. Please keep it as simple as it can be, I'm not a mobile developer, so I don't have the tools installed yet. I wanted you to help me not just to build the mobile app, but also help me to setup a test enviroment so I can validate the app. I have a MacBook pro and an Android phone, please suggest a simple test environment, doesn't need to run on the actual phone, it only needs to be simple and as quick as possible.
