USER PROMPT 032:

Request: Please review the Makefile, Dockerfile and docker-compose.yaml fields and help me to make it always update the docker image whenever I run make up. I feel like it is not getting my recent changes on the backend

CONTEXT: User wants to ensure that Docker always rebuilds the backend image with latest code changes when running make up, suspecting that cached images are preventing updates from being reflected

RESOLUTION NEEDED: Review and update Docker configuration files to force rebuild of images and ensure latest code changes are always included

STATUS: Need to examine and modify Docker build/deployment configuration
